# World's Smallest Vulkan Compatability Test

This tiny program checks if your Windows system is capable of creating
a Vulkan instance. If not, it will give a hint as to why (missing
drivers, malfunctioning drivers, incompatible drivers).

This began as my initial foray into Vulkan, only to disappoint me that
my hardware isn't supported.
